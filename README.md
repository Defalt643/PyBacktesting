# [WIP] Using the Elliott Wave Theory to forecast the financial markets and optimize with a genetic algorithm

Hi! 

My name is Philippe. In this project, I'm modeling the Elliott Wave Theory to forecast the financial markets. There is no real technique at the moment to model the Elliott Wave Theory as it is difficult to model and can be highly subjective.

WRITE THE SUMMARY HERE

To find about this project, just scroll down

To see the list of the hyperparameters and parameters to optimize, go to this [file](https://github.com/philos123/PyBacktesting/blob/master/initialize.py)

1- A clear explanation of the problem your're trying to solve and why it's important<br />
2- A summary of your data cleaning and exploration. including visualizations<br />
3- How you created a baseline model<br />
4- Your logic for selecting models to test, tuning models and measuring their efficacy (Share Ratio in this case)<br />
5- The results that you got for each model and making predictions, including vizualisations here<br />
6- Your approach to training the final model and making predictions<br />
7- A summary of the projects, results, findings and area that could be improved or explored in the future<br />


``` python
#import your libraries
import pandas as pd
import sklearn as sk

AT THE END
What we would like to improve : - test on other market, using retracements
