# Using the Elliott Wave Theory to forecast the financial markets and optimize with a genetic algorithm

## Introduction

[WIP] Library to find trend (using regression analysis and Mann-Kendall), then buy/sell setback using Fibonacci retracements and extension

1- A clear explanation of the problem your're trying to solve and why it's important<br />
2- A summary of your data cleaning and exploration. including visualizations<br />
3- How you created a baseline model<br />
4- Your logic for selecting models to test, tuning models and measuring their efficacy (Share Ratio in this case)<br />
5- The results that you got for each model and making predictions, including vizualisations here<br />
6- Your approach to training the final model and making predictions<br />
7- A summary of the projects, results, findings and area that could be improved or explored in the future<br />


``` python
#import your libraries
import pandas as pd
import sklearn as sk
#etc

What we would like to improve : - test on other market, using retracements
