# [WIP] Using the Elliott Wave Theory to forecast the financial markets and optimize with a genetic algorithm


Hi! 

My name is Philippe. The goal of this project is to model the Elliott Wave Theory to forecast the financial markets. Once we have the model and know the parameters, we optimize it using a machine learning technique called genetic algorithm and test in a different period (Walk forward optimization). The fitness function we're using for optimization and testing is the Sharpe ratio. 

The experiment was carried out on the EUR/USD currency pair on hourly basis data. The time period was from 2015/10 to 2020/04 (including 2 training and 2 testing periods). The training periods were each 18 months each (2015-10-15 to 2017-04-15 and 2018-01-15 to 2019-07-15) and the testing periods were 9 months each  (2017-04-15 to 2018-01-15 and 2019-07-15 to 2020-04-15). 

For each training period, the Sharpe ratio was above 3, which is excellent. For the testing period, the results were mixed. For the first testing period, the Sharpe ratio was 1.63, which is really good. For the second testing period, the Sharpe ratio -13.99 with 0 winning trades.

One of the issue with the model during the testing periods is that generated few trades (11 for the first testing period and 10 for second testing period). This may be due to the fact that the model is highly optimized (overfit). We could also test the same model on different assets and different timeframes.

The library is divided so that it is possible to modify the trading strategy by creating modules in the different packages (indicators, optimize, trading_rules). For example, the current rule for trying to enter the market is when a trend is detected (r2 and Mann-Kendall). We could create a new module that tries to enter the market when we are 2 standard deviations from the average price of the last 100 days (in the trading_rules package).

## Part 1 - DEFINE

### ---- 1 Defining the problem ----

The goal of this project is to model the Elliott Wave Theory to forecast the financial markets. Once we have the model and know the parameters, we optimize it using a machine learning technique called genetic algorithm and test in a different period (Walk forward optimization). The fitness function we're using for optimization and testing is the Sharpe ratio. 

There is no real technique at the moment to model the Elliott Wave Theory as it is difficult to model and the modeling is highly subjective. To understand the concept of Elliott Wave Theory, refer to this [post](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/111401.asp).

Since the optimization space of a trading strategy can be complex, genetic algorithms are efficient are efficient machine learning technique for this kind of optimization. They mimic the biological process of evolution.

## Part 2 - DISCOVER

### ---- 2 Loading the data ----

The experiment was carried out on the EUR/USD currency pair on hourly basis data. The time period was from 2015/10 to 2020/04 (including 2 training and 2 testing periods). The training periods were each 18 months each (2015-10-15 to 2017-04-15 and 2018-01-15 to 2019-07-15) and the testing periods were 9 months each  (2017-04-15 to 2018-01-15 and 2019-07-15 to 2020-04-15). 

The data source for this experiment was [Dukascopy](https://www.dukascopy.com/swiss/english/marketwatch/historical/) as a lot of data was needed on an hourly basis. The program read the data in a csv format. If you want to do an experiment on a different asset and/or timeframe, make sure to load the data in the folder of your choice and change the path with the variable `self.directory` in [initialize.py](https://github.com/philos123/PyBacktesting/blob/master/initialize.py). 

If less data is needed for an experiment or the experiment is carried on daily basis data, the Alpha Vantage API is a great source to get free and quality data (with certain restrictions, like a maximum API call per minute). [This](https://algotrading101.com/learn/alpha-vantage-guide/) is a great article on the Alpha Vantage API.

```
Parameters
----------
`self.directory` : str
    Where the the data are located for training and testing periods
`self.asset` : str
    Name of the file where we get the data
`self.is_fx` : bool
    Tell if `self.asset` is forex (the data don't have the same format for forex and stocks because they are
    from different providers).
`self.dir_output` : str
    Where we store the results
`self.name_out` : str
    Name of the results file name (csv)
`self.start_date` : datetime object
    Beginning date of training and testing period. The variable is already transformed from a str to a 
    Datetime object
`self.end_date` : datetime object
    Ending date of training and testing period. The variable is already transformed from a str to a 
    Datetime object

self.directory = '/Users/philippeostiguy/Desktop/Trading/Programmation_python/Trading/'
self.dir_output = '/Users/philippeostiguy/Desktop/Trading/Programmation_python/Trading/results/'
self.name_out = 'results'
self.is_fx = True
self.asset = "EURUSD"
self.start_date = datetime.strptime('2015-10-15', "%Y-%m-%d")
self.end_date = datetime.strptime('2016-02-18', "%Y-%m-%d")
```

We can examine our data : 

```
series_.head()
```
| #    | Date                | Open    | High    | Low     | Adj Close |
|------|---------------------|---------|---------|---------|-----------|
| 96   | 2015-10-15 00:00:00 | 1.14809 | 1.14859 | 1.14785 | 1.14801   |
| 97   | 2015-10-15 01:00:00 | 1.14802 | 1.14876 | 1.14788 | 1.14828   |
| 98   | 2015-10-15 02:00:00 | 1.14831 | 1.14950 | 1.14768 | 1.14803   |
| 99   | 2015-10-15 03:00:00 | 1.14802 | 1.14826 | 1.14254 | 1.14375   |
| 100  | 2015-10-15 04:00:00 | 1.14372 | 1.14596 | 1.14335 | 1.14417   |

And see the lenght, value types and if there are empty values (none) :

```
series_.info()
```

| # | Column    | Non-Null Count | Dtype          |
|---|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| 0 | Date      | 28176 non-null | datetime64[ns] |
| 1 | Open      | 28176 non-null | float64        |
| 2 | High      | 28176 non-null | float64        |
| 3 | Low       | 28176 non-null | float64        |
| 4 | Adj Close | 28176 non-null | float64        |


### ---- 3 Cleaning the data ----

In [manip_data.py](https://github.com/philos123/PyBacktesting/blob/master/manip_data.py), we drop the nan value, if any (none) and remove the data when the market is closed with `series_.drop_duplicates(keep=False,subset=list(dup_col.keys()))`

```
series_ = series_.dropna() #drop nan values
if dup_col != None:
    #If all values in column self.dup_col are the same, we erase them
    series_ = series_.drop_duplicates(keep=False,subset=list(dup_col.keys()))
series_=series_.reset_index(drop=True)
```

We can see that it removed 172 data.

| # | Column    | Non-Null Count | Dtype          |
|---|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| 0 | Date      | 28024 non-null | datetime64[ns] |
| 1 | Open      | 28024 non-null | float64        |
| 2 | High      | 28024 non-null | float64        |
| 3 | Low       | 28024 non-null | float64        |
| 4 | Adj Close | 28024 non-null | float64        |


### ---- 4 Exploring the data (EDA) ----
The time period was from 2015/10 to 2020/04 (including 2 training and 2 testing periods). The training periods were each 18 months each (2015-10-15 to 2017-04-15 and 2018-01-15 to 2019-07-15) and the testing periods were 9 months each (2017-04-15 to 2018-01-15 and 2019-07-15 to 2020-04-15). We can see the split on chart below.

```
x = np.linspace(pd.Timestamp(self.start_date), pd.Timestamp(self.end_date),len(self.series))
y = self.series.loc[:,self.default_data]

segment1 = (x < pd.Timestamp('2017-04-15').value)
segment2 = (x >= pd.Timestamp('2017-04-15').value) & (x < pd.Timestamp('2018-01-15').value)
segment3 = (x >= pd.Timestamp('2018-01-15').value) & (x < pd.Timestamp('2019-07-15').value)
segment4 = (x >= pd.Timestamp('2019-07-15').value)

x = pd.to_datetime(x)

plt.plot(x[segment1], y[segment1], '-b', lw=1)
plt.plot(x[segment2], y[segment2], '-g', lw=1)
plt.plot(x[segment3], y[segment3], '-b', lw=1)
plt.plot(x[segment4], y[segment4], '-g', lw=1)

plt.show()
```

The blue represents the 2 training periods and the green represents the 2 testing periods

![](https://github.com/philos123/PyBacktesting/blob/master/images/period_split.png)

If someone would like to do standard time series analysis like ARIMA (not the case here), we would have to check if the serie is stationary. The [Augmented Dickeyâ€“Fuller test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_Dickey%E2%80%93Fuller_test) does that

```
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller

series_diff = self.series.copy()
if adfuller(series_diff[self.default_data])[1] > self.p_value:
    raise Exception("The series is not stationary")

```

If the serie is not stationary and it's only a matter of "trend", first differencing is in general fine to make a financial time series stationary. It there is seasonality, other manipulations may be required

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

series_diff = self.series.copy()
series_diff.drop([self.date_name, self.date_ordinal_name], axis=1, inplace=True)
series_diff = series_diff.diff(periods=self.period)  # differentiate with previous row
series_diff.loc[:(self.period - 1), :] = 0 #Make first row equal to 0
series_diff.insert(0, self.date_name, self.series[self.date_name]) #re-insert the period columns

plt.plot(self.series_test[self.date_name], self.series_test[self.default_data])
plt.show()
```

### ---- 5 Establishing a baseline ----

To make it simple and as a first version, this strategy is meant to try to enter the market when a trend is found. Note that we might be violating the assumption that there is no autocorrelation and that the error terms should follow a normal distribution, but for for the sake of simplicity, we'll assume the absence of serial correlation and that the error terms follow a normal distribution. Also, the statistical tests are used to determine if there is a trend, not to forecast the financial market. A ways around this would be to make the serie stationary.

First using the Mann-Kendall test (non-parametric methods), we check if there is a trend in the market. It's better than linear regression as it does not require the data to be normally distributed or linear. It returns a 1 when there is a upward trend, -1 when there is a downward trend and 0 when there is no trend. More explanations and details about the code [here](https://github.com/philos123/PyBacktesting/blob/master/indicators/regression/mann_kendall.py)

Then using the coefficient of determination (R^2), we assess the strenght of the trend. By default, the thresold value `self.r_square_level` in `initialize.py` to say that the trend is significant is 0.7.  More explanations and details about the code [here](https://github.com/philos123/PyBacktesting/blob/master/indicators/regression/linear_regression.py)

Example below with dots on chart when the r^2 is above 0.7 and Mann-Kendall is -1 or 1

![](https://github.com/philos123/PyBacktesting/blob/master/images/Trading_rules.png)

Whenever we have a trend confirmation, the program tries to enter in the market using the Elliott Wave Theory in the module [entry_fibo](https://github.com/philos123/PyBacktesting/blob/master/entry/entry_fibo.py). First, the method finds local minimum and maximum in the current trend with function `self.local_extremum_()`. It checks if the values for a number of points on each side (`window`) are greater or lesser and then determine the local extremum. Assessing a local extremum on a financial time series can be tricky, but this method gives satisfactory results.

```
from scipy.signal import argrelextrema
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

cls.series=cls.series.loc[start_point:end_point,cls.default_col]
cls.series=pd.DataFrame({cls.default_col: cls.series})

cls.series[min_] = cls.series.iloc[argrelextrema(cls.series.values, np.less_equal,
                                                  order=window)[0]][cls.default_col]
cls.series[max_] = cls.series.iloc[argrelextrema(cls.series.values, np.greater_equal,
                                                  order=window)[0]][cls.default_col]
cls.series[index_] = cls.series.index
plt.scatter(cls.series.index, cls.series[min_], c='r')
plt.scatter(cls.series.index, cls.series[max_], c='g')

plt.plot(cls.series.index, cls.series[cls.default_col])
plt.ion()
plt.show()
        
```
![](https://github.com/philos123/PyBacktesting/blob/master/images/Local_extremum.png)

Then using `self.largest_extension()`, it sets the largest setback, which the difference between local maximum and the previous local minimum for a downward trend and the difference between the local maximum and and the next local minimum for an upward trend. In the above example, the largest setback in the downward trend would be the difference between the value at the index 148 (1.11292) minus the index at the index 139 (1.10818) for a result of 0.0047. This value play a key role for the entry and the exit level.

When the largest setback is set, it will try to enter the market with the function `self.try_entry()` in the module [entry_fibo](https://github.com/philos123/PyBacktesting/blob/master/entry/entry_fibo.py)

Then if the system is able to enter in the market, it will exit wheter if a stop loss is trigger or the profit level is reached using the again the logic with the largest setback (and using the Elliott Wave Theory). Please refer to this [module](https://github.com/philos123/PyBacktesting/blob/master/exit/exit_fibo.py) for more information

There a different values that can be used for the Elliott Wave Theory. Again, please refer to the module [initialize.py](https://github.com/philos123/PyBacktesting/blob/master/initialize.py) to see all the parameters that can be optimized using a genetic algorithm and their default values.

The metric used to evalute the performance of the trading strategy is the Sharpe ratio. It's the most common metric used to evaluate a trading strategy.

![](https://github.com/philos123/PyBacktesting/blob/master/images/Sharep_ratio.gif)


S<sub>a</sub> =	Sharpe ratio
E = expected value
R<sub>a</sub> =	asset return
R<sub>b</sub> =	risk free return
Ïƒ<sub>a</sub> = standard deviation of the asset excess return


Using the default values 

AT THE END

What we would like to improve : - test on other market, using retracements
